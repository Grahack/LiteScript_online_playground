## Free form Object Literal

Defines an object with a list of key value pairs. 
Each pair can be in it's own line. A indent denotes a new level deep.
FreeObjectLiterals are triggered by a "dangling assignment"

Examples: 

    var x =            
          a: 1 
          b:           
            b1:"a lite"
            b2:"script"

    var y =

       c:{d:1}

       trimester:[
         "January"
         "February"
         "March"
       ]

       getValue: function(i)
          return y.trimester[i]


    var data =

       control:0

       valid: true

       contents:

           months:
              qty:12
              names: [
                      "J","F",
                      "M","A","M","J"
                      "J","A","S","O"
                      "N","D" 
                     ]

    for each m in data.contents.months.names
        print m
