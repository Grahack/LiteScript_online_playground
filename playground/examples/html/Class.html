## ClassDeclaration

`ClassDeclaration: class IDENTIFIER [[","] (extends|inherits from)] Body`

Classes are defined with the `class` keyword and are just
syntactic sugar for js Capitalized functions (js function-classes).

`properties` can be declared inside the `class`, they are
the valid members of each instance.

The `constructor` function, if present, is used as the body 
for the function-class. Default constructor calls 
super constructor: `super.constructor.apply(this,arguments)`
and assigns values to declared properties.

`method`s can be declared inside the `class` body, 
and are functions added to the prototype.


Example:

### Class Person 
This is an example of some class, the title above is CODE, because 
the title line start with 'class'. This text is not code. 
This is a comment paragraph, which explains the class usage, 
and, because its location, has high chances to kept attached 
to the class in code refactorings. 

      properties
        name
        stooge:boolean=true
    
      method hello
        print "Hello! I'm #{.name}"

Now test the class

    var a = new Person('Moe')
    a.hello

> Hello! I'm Moe

Note: `.name` is short for `this.name`
