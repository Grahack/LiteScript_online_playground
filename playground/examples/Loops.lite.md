## While/Until Loop ##

While/Until Loop is the *pre-check* conditional loop.
The condition is evaluated *before* entering the loop.

Examples:

plain old C and js `while` loop still works the same

    var x = 0
    while x < 6
      x++
      print x

loop *until* condition is true, checks first

    x = 0
    until x is 5
      x++
      print x


## Do while|until... loop while|until ##

DoLoop is the *post-check* conditional loop
The condition is evaluated *after* the loop body.

### Case 1) do-loop without any condition

a do-loop without any condition is an *infinite loop* 
(usually with a `break` statement inside)

Example:

    x=1
    do
        x++
        print x
        when x is 10, break
    loop


### Case 2) do-loop with pre-condition

A do-loop with pre-condition, is the same as a while|until loop

Example:

    x=1
    do while x<10
        x++
        print x
    loop


### Case 3) do-loop with post-condition

A do-loop with post-condition, execute the block, at least once, and after each iteration, 
checks the post-condition, and loops `while` the expression is true
*or* `until` the expression is true 

Example:

    x=1
    do
        x++
        print x
    loop while x < 10

    x=1
    do
        x++
        print x
    loop until x is 5
