Preprocessor 
============

LiteScript compiler allows you to execute small pieces of code,
-in the process of compilation- generating LiteScript code lines on the fly.

The `compiler generate` meta-statement, will:
1. read the indented 'body'
2. compile the body, run it, (the body should push on lines:string array)
3. replace 'compiler generate + Body' with the generated lines.

Example:

    print "this code is static"
    print "but the next statements are generated on the fly"
    print "by using meta-statement 'compiler generate'"

build date, updated at compile-time

    compiler generate(lines:string array)
        lines.push "var buildDate = '#{new Date}'"

    print "this code was compiled on #{buildDate}"

silly

    compiler generate(lines:string array)
        for n=1 to 10
            lines.push "print #{n}"
